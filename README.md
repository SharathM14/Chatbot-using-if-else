# Chatbot-using-if-else
This chatbot project demonstrates the fundamentals of rule-based natural language processing using Python. It operates through a continuous input/output loop, allowing users to interact until they choose to exit. The chatbot processes user input by converting it to lowercase for consistent matching, then evaluates it using a series of `if-elif-else` conditions. Each condition checks for specific keywords or phrases like greetings, questions about the bot’s identity, or common conversational topics such as weather. When a match is found, the bot responds with a predefined message. If no match is detected, it prompts the user to rephrase, simulating a basic fallback mechanism. This approach helps beginners understand how simple logic can drive conversational flow. It also introduces key NLP concepts like keyword detection and response mapping. While limited in flexibility, this structure lays the groundwork for more advanced systems involving pattern recognition, machine learning, or intent classification. Overall, it’s a practical starting point for exploring chatbot development and basic user interaction design.
